            Using a dataset like this one you mentioned, which includes various match statistics such as attendance, shots, goals, and league position, can provide valuable insights and benefits for several purposes. Here are some reasons why you might use this dataset and what it can offer:
<br>
<strong> Analysis: </strong>The dataset allows you to analyze the performance of teams based on various match statistics. You can assess factors like shots on target, goals scored, and league position to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of teams' attacking capabilities. This information can be crucial in understanding team strategies, identifying strengths and weaknesses, and making informed decisions related to player recruitment, training, and tactics.
<br>
<strong>Comparison and Benchmarking:</strong> By examining the dataset, you can compare and benchmark different teams against each other. This analysis can help you identify standout performers, evaluate their relative strengths in terms of shots on target and goals scored, and draw comparisons between teams' performances in different seasons or across different leagues. It can aid in assessing a team's competitiveness and positioning within the broader context of their respective leagues.
<br>
<strong>Trend Identification:</strong> The dataset allows you to track and identify trends in team performance over time. By analyzing the historical data, you can observe patterns in terms of shots on target, goals scored, and league position. This can assist in identifying teams that consistently perform well or teams that have experienced fluctuations in their performance. Understanding these trends can provide insights into factors such as managerial changes, player transfers, or changes in team dynamics.
<br>
<strong>Decision Making and Strategy:</strong> Utilizing this dataset can inform decision-making processes in various areas. Clubs, coaches, and analysts can leverage the insights gained from analyzing the data to make informed decisions related to team strategy, tactics, player recruitment, and resource allocation. For example, understanding a team's historical goals scored and shots on target can aid in setting realistic performance targets, formulating game plans, or identifying areas for improvement.
<br>
<strong>Fan Engagement and Storytelling:</strong> The dataset can be used to enhance fan engagement and storytelling by providing interesting and relevant statistics to fans, journalists, and content creators. Visualizations and narratives based on the data can add depth and context to match reports, news articles, or social media posts, making the content more engaging and informative for fans.
<br>
In summary, utilizing this dataset can provide valuable insights into team performance, enable comparison and benchmarking, identify trends, support decision-making processes, and enhance fan engagement. The analysis of match statistics can help in understanding team dynamics, evaluating performance, and making data-driven decisions across various aspects of the football ecosystem.

          <p>The reason behind using a dataset like this is down to my intrest in football and by using a dataset that I have an intrest in makes it easier to work with as I feel I will want to find out more about the data than what I would if I wasnt as intrested or envolved with the data as I am with this one.</p>
          <p>So to start this project I went to google datasets which is a platform that enables users to discover and access a wide range of publicly available datasets from various domains for research, analysis, and machine learning purposes. By using this platform I can find many different datasets on things I am intresting in so I descided to go with a football dataset, this then finding me a dataset supplied by a user on kaggle.
            <br> So for this project I chose to use Google Colab, which is very simiar to jupiter notebook, using google colab is easy for me if i want to continue the project from another device as i simply have the dataset and the notebook on the cloud.
          <br> To get started in Google Colab my first line of code would be
